2.02                                                         July 18, 2001

   * CPAN.pm is loaded on demand only. Thanks to Benjamin Trott for the 
     patch.

2.00                                                          May 29, 2001

   * A versioning fix.  No change to the code.

1.12                                                        April 30, 2001

    * Changed the code to handle escaping of Args in _load(). Args are now
      serialized with Data::Dumper (and processed a bit) before eval().
      This lets us handle references & nested structures properly.

1.8                                                         April 28, 2001

    * Included tests in the distribition.

1.7                                                         April 28, 2001

    * Introduced CPAN switch in calls to _load()

    * Wrote ::new()

    * Small Documentation changes.

1.6                                                         April 27, 2001

    * First release.
